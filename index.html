            <h1>What is this about?</h1>
            <p>The purpose of this document is to present the proposals for the visual style of the new HPE platform called <strong>Products & Solutionts Now</strong>.</p><p>Elements and their disposition on the interface are based on the wireframes and requirements worked together and agreed with HPE.</p>
            <p>Fonts and colours used are based on the <a href="http://grommet.io/docs/hpe/design/basics" target="_blank">HPE styleguide</a>.</p>
            <h2>Design basis</h2>
            <p>We want to reach an impact on the user with the name of the platform to help and improve its recordability. We think that right now it is important that the user familiarizes himself as soon as possible with the new platform, remembering itâ€™s name and consecuently separating it from My Sales Guide. We prioritize visually the name of the platform in the home page on both proposals, so it hits the user on every first landing.</p>
            <p>We have based the design on the primary colors of HPE color palette, black and green over a white background, to keep a clean interface. We have used the same green colour of the main rectangle of HPE logo to point out the selected items, mixed with blue for buttons and calls to action. With this combination we can gain a clean separation between main interaction elements, keeping HPE branding clearly on every page.</p>
            <p>The main goal of the user in the platform is to find assets and resources. To accomplish that, user can browse through the tiles or perform a search. Tile browsing and search are consecuently the main functionalities offered to the user, so they must be always present and visually outstanded.</p>
            <h2>Two different approaches for the same goal</h2>
            <p>Based on the above design bases, we have elaborated two different home page approaches to reach the same end results, but focusing on different brand strenghts on the road:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The approach that we have called <a href="#squared">squared</a> is maybe the more clasical one. This proposal is constructed upon straight lines, squares and rectangles, using a background image to boost the recordability of the platform naming. </li>
              <li>The approach that we have called <a href="#rounded">rounded</a> is a more clean and minimalist design, focusing more on user interaction than the squared one. This proposal offers more sense of dynamism and adaptability, while fully integrating the HPE branding.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>From both home proposals, we come to the same visual design for the internal web pages. Even both home page approaches seem to be far away from each other, the fact that they share the same visual design for the internal pages points out that they are actually really close.  Design for internal pages is focused on functionallity and user interaction, avoiding visual noise and any unnecessary elements from a functional point of view. No matter of that, brand is allways present in the internal pages thorough the fonts, colours, squared shapes and of course platform name, always present at the top left of the page.</p>
